# Somney

Will be working on Somney for a while and adding a bunch of stuff like story features, very low demanding program, just run it in the backround or whatever.
This is only a test build so dont expect much except for a few tweaks and stuff like that. (Somney is made with C#)
Also, the program files got wiped so I have to start it again but it takes like 10 minutes.
